# TCGA-project

Recent advances in comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) together with the ongoing digitization
of electronic health records (EHR) has led to rich real world data (RWD) resources, provided and
curated by companies like Flatiron Health or Foundation Medicine. An ever increasing publication
base provides evidence that integrative analysis of EHR and CGP data could be valuable to both:
Support and improve drug development as well as improve patient care by providing personalized
healthcare (PHC). In contrast to a classic one-drug-for-all paradigm, PHC exploits individual clinical
and molecular characteristics of a patient’s disease in order to identify the best treatment option
for each individual patient, powered by insights from RWD. A first step towards true PHC is a solid
understanding of today’s treatment of patients and the treatment effect (outcomes). The methods
and tools developed in this PROJECT will be a first step towards empowering researchers and
clinicians with insights generation from EHR and CGP data.
